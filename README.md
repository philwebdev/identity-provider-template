# Identity Provider Template with OAuth2 using OpenIddict

This template provides a starting point for creating an Identity Provider (IDP) based on OAuth2 using OpenIddict in a .NET Core project. The IDP can be used to manage user authentication and authorization, providing OAuth2 tokens for secure access to protected resources.

## Features

- Implementation of an Identity Provider based on OAuth2 using OpenIddict.
- Default configuration for managing user authentication and authorization.
- Provides endpoints for managing OAuth2 tokens (e.g., /connect/token, /connect/authorize).
- Integrated with .NET Core's security and authentication features.
- Utilizes Clean Architecture.
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses PostgreSQL as the database for this example.


## Versions

- .NET 8
- OpenIddict 5.3.0

## Instructions for Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the template with the desired settings for authentication, authorization, and user management.
3. Run the project and access the endpoints for managing authentication and OAuth2 tokens.
